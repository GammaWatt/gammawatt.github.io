Title says it all. This should be a quickie.
But you will require a valid phone number, either upon creating your account, or offering it up upon applying for a developer account, since that just how things are, now.

The idea, here, is just to get something that'll fulfill the following:
* Schedule posts to twitter
* Free / open source
* No SaaS provider or server required

So, to do that, we'll take some shortcuts.

Download `at`. On Debian-based ditros, it's `sudo apt install -y at`. Use your distro's corresponding package manager.

Next, install tweepy. It's usually a good idea to do this in a virtual environment.
1. `mkdir ./twitsched && cd ./twitsched`
2. `python -m venv env`
3. `source ./env/bin/activate`
4. `python -m pip install tweepy python-dotenv`

I added `python-dotenv` because we'll need some token keys and such. 
It's generally bad practice to hardcode them into an app, and really 
annoying to pass them into environment variables manually all the time.

Log into Twitter, or make an account, go to 
[https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access)
and apply for a developer account.

They want statistics or something.... so tell them we're hobbyists making bots and  click whatever confirmation button shows up to continue.
